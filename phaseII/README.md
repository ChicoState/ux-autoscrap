# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

For this phase, we had our fellow UX researchers perform a Cognitive Walkthrough for each of our personas and scenarios. Each of our 3 personas had a scenario attached to them. Five Cognitive Walkthroughs were performed by outside UX researchers. Each Cognitive Walkthrough broke down a scenario into the steps they took and at each one they would answer some questions: Will the user know what to do? If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal? These questions were answered and documented at each step until either the task was complete or could not be pursued further.

Our other main research method this phase was the use of informal feedback. We gave our fellow software engineers three questions to ask for feedback during their sprint I demonstration:  
Is there any feature missing from the homepage that you think is needed?  
How easy is it currently to navigate and find listings for parts?  
Are there any changes you would make to make this more user friendly?

The rest of the software engineers in their section would give constructive feedback for these questions. Our software engineers documented the feedback and gave us the results. 

## Findings

Through our Cognitive Walkthroughs, we found key weaknesses and missing features needed in our application. This research method showcases how usable and learnable the current interface of the product is and where there could be improvements. All of the Cognitive Walkthroughs performed were unable to complete their task in full due to either missing features or confusion on where to go next. The tasks seemed doable up until being able to either put parts for listings or for actually being able to bid or buy a part after finding it. There was also confusion on whether our product was meant to host the part listings or if the user would be redirected to a new site to continue the process. Streamlining the process for finding and bidding on parts is paramount in keeping users from becoming frustrated and discouraged.

Through our informal feedback, we received multiple varied insights from outside software engineers for each of the three questions we posed. We saw that having a way to filter or sort the listings was needed for easier navigation. Another good missing feature suggested was using user car information to easily narrow down part searches. Finally we got some suggestions for other user friendly options like user reviews, bid history, and an auction timer.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
