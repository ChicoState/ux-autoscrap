# Autoscrap

Autoscrapâ„¢ is an app designed to help people who are in need of a car part for the cheapest possible price.  This app will also help those who have parts to sell move inventory with ease and maintain an online listing for any parts they have to sell.  So the users are buyers and sellers alike and will hopefully have their interests met with our app.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

* **Executive Summary**

  * Competitive analysis showed us there is really only one website that has mostly achieved our goal, their website is severely outdated and lacks any mobile     designs.  We can offer a much more modern form factor and also allow individuals to buy parts via a wanted ad.
  * Heuristic evaluation of our most direct competitor, car-part.com, shows that we stand to gain a lot of ground when it comes to aesthetics and simplifying the search form.
  * Although the majority of users of our service will want to see an aesthetically pleasing and functional UI, they will also require a vast database from which they can search from to find the parts they require.
  * Users will be able to create their own accounts and buyers can save cars they are commonly searching for, preventing the unnecessary reentering of details for each part they search for.
  * Our development of personas and scenarios allow us to confirm what we saw in our analysis and evaluations, such as:
    * Aesthetically pleasing UI as well as easy to use in repetition.
    * In order to be a one-stop-shop, users want a vast database of parts to choose from to ensure the best price possible.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

* **Executive Summary**

  * Informal Feedback was useful in shedding some light on some issues we would otherwise not see.
    * Having less buttons can help workflow from the initial search to the results page.
    * Maximizing the space dedicated to search results is a desirable design.
  * Cognitive Walkthroughs helped us focus on unforseen factors such as the wellbeing of our users, as well as, valuing their time.
  * Wireframes help greatly in the visualization of our app and address any missing or misleading features.
    * Sign up or Sign in feature to minimize the workflow for repeat users.
    * Search filters that help narrow the search for car parts with as little effort as possible.
    * Adding an importance to images for the parts and the UI to improve the user's experience.
