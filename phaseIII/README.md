# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

The AutoScrap Usability Engineering team conducted usability tests with users on May 7th, 2024 (n = 7). Our UX team first created a working Prototype of our product from our wireframes. The next steps we took were to create a protocol/script for the Pilot test, generate an Informed Consent Form, and finally submit an IRB form to make our Pilot tests official. Our protocol for the Pilot test includes background information questions, tasks for the user to complete on our application, and a debrief section for feedback to close it out.  

Our group focused on a more formative approach when it came to designing our protocol. Things like what usability issues exist in our product and does the user understands our navigation were what our researchers were looking for during testing. We also implemented a think-aloud approach for the users when doing the tasks so we could get more information on how they approached each task. The current moderator for each Pilot test would take notes on how the user approached each task and any issues that occurred.  

The 7 participants were other student UX researchers from our class. We had a requirement for each participant to be over the age of 18.  

At the beginning of our Pilot test protocol, we asked each participant a few background questions. The first question “What kind of car do you own?” would help us interpret the data we receive from them during the process. If the answer to the previous question was yes, the second question would be “Have you ever bought a used car part before?” This question would help us see if the user had previous experience with something similar to what our product has to offer. Question three was then “If so, where was it bought from and how easy was it to get?” This question focused on competitors and the user’s experience with their overall product usability. Our final question was “Was there anything that could have been improved?” This question’s purpose was to see if there were any glaring issues or missing features in our competitors that our product could take advantage of.  

The next step of our Pilot test would test our prototype by having the participant do four separate tasks. We asked the user to explain their thought process while doing each task. We also kept track of whether or not they completed each task and asked them to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. 
The first task was “Imagine that your Ford Bronco broke down and needs a new set of spark plugs. You have a budget of $500 to use on bidding for it. Walk through the steps you would take to find the car part and place a bid within the given budget.” This task focused on seeing how usable our search bar and filters were when finding a specific car part. The user would then have to place a bid which would be on the details page of the filtered car part listing. A key aspect was seeing if the user used both the search and filter and whether one was used together or sequentially. This process is the crux of our product and seeing its usability is paramount.  

The second task was “Imagine you inherited a 2020 GMC Terrain from your long lost uncle and now you need some money. Walk me through the steps you would take to create a listing of a part of the car on the site.” This task focused on our product’s ability to have users create listings for used car parts. We wanted to see if users could easily find where to create a part listing. 
The third task was “You want to add your 2021 Ford Bronco with a V6 engine to help narrow down your searches. How would you go about doing that?” While similar to the first task, this one was focused on our saved car feature. This feature allowed users to input aspects of the car like make, model, engine, and year and have it be like a more permanent filter. Finding a car part that fits your exact car is tough so having a way to filter down to one specific kind is very useful.  

Our final task was “Imagine that an hour has passed and you want to see if someone has outbid you on the spark plugs you wanted to get. Explain how you would go about checking whether you have been outbid or not and if you have, make a new higher bid on the car part.” This last task focused on our profile page which held information about a user’s listings and bids. This page would detail their bids alongside the time left, the price they bid at, and the current price which could be something higher. Our product is essentially an auction site for used car parts so being able to see if you have been outbid or not is a key feature that needs to work.  

The last part of the Pilot test was a debriefing. We first asked “What did you like best?” to find out what feature stood out the most as helpful for the user. The next question was “Anything stand out as unintuitive or not clear when finding or bidding for a part?” This question was to find anything off or missing when it came to the core loop of our product with searching for used car parts. Afterward, we followed that up with “Anything else that could be improved?”. This question is broader in scope allowing for suggestions in any other aspect of our product like profile pages or details. Our final question was “What other features would you like to see on our platform?” This question would help us find any other features that would be good to implement. These features could be from competitors or other similar products that we have either missed or not thought about.  


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
